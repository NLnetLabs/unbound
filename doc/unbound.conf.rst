unbound.conf(5)
===============

Synopsis
--------

**unbound.conf**

Description
-----------

**unbound.conf** is used to configure :doc:`unbound(8)</manpages/unbound>`.
The file format has attributes and values.
Some attributes have attributes inside them.
The notation is: ``attribute: value``.

Comments start with ``#`` and last to the end of line.
Empty lines are ignored as is whitespace at the beginning of a line.

The utility :doc:`unbound-checkconf(8)</manpages/unbound-checkconf>` can be
used to check ``unbound.conf`` prior to usage.

Example
-------

An example config file is shown below.
Copy this to :file:`/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` and start the server with:

.. code-block:: text

    $ unbound -c /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

Most settings are the defaults.
Stop the server with:

.. code-block:: text

    $ kill `cat /etc/unbound/unbound.pid`

Below is a minimal config file.
The source distribution contains an extensive :file:`example.conf` file with
all the options.

.. code-block:: text

    # unbound.conf(5) config file for unbound(8).
    server:
        directory: "/etc/unbound"
        username: unbound
        # make sure unbound can access entropy from inside the chroot.
        # e.g. on linux the use these commands (on BSD, devfs(8) is used):
        #      mount --bind -n /dev/urandom /etc/unbound/dev/urandom
        # and  mount --bind -n /dev/log /etc/unbound/dev/log
        chroot: "/etc/unbound"
        # logfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.log"  #uncomment to use logfile.
        pidfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.pid"
        # verbosity: 1      # uncomment and increase to get more logging.
        # listen on all interfaces, answer queries from the local subnet.
        interface: 0.0.0.0
        interface: ::0
        access-control: 10.0.0.0/8 allow
        access-control: 2001:DB8::/64 allow

File Format
-----------

There must be whitespace between keywords.
Attribute keywords end with a colon ``':'``.
An attribute is followed by a value, or its containing attributes in which case
it is referred to as a clause.
Clauses can be repeated throughout the file (or included files) to group
attributes under the same clause.

.. _unbound.conf.include:

Files can be included using the **include:** directive.
It can appear anywhere, it accepts a single file name as argument.
Processing continues as if the text from the included file was copied into the
config file at that point.
If also using :ref:`chroot<unbound.conf.chroot>`, using full path names for
the included files works, relative pathnames for the included names work if the
directory where the daemon is started equals its chroot/working directory or is
specified before the include statement with :ref:`directory:
dir<unbound.conf.directory>`.
Wildcards can be used to include multiple files, see *glob(7)*.

.. _unbound.conf.include-toplevel:

For a more structural include option, the **include-toplevel:** directive can
be used.
This closes whatever clause is currently active (if any) and forces the use of
clauses in the included files and right after this directive.

.. _unbound.conf.server:

Server Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These options are part of the **server:** clause.


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@verbosity@@: *<number>*
    The verbosity level.

    Level 0
        No verbosity, only errors.

    Level 1
        Gives operational information.

    Level 2
        Gives detailed operational information including short information per
        query.

    Level 3
        Gives query level information, output per query.

    Level 4
        Gives algorithm level information.

    Level 5
        Logs client identification for cache misses.

    The verbosity can also be increased from the command line and during run
    time via remote control. See :doc:`unbound(8)</manpages/unbound>` and
    :doc:`unbound-control(8)</manpages/unbound-control>` respectively.

    Default: 1


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@statistics-interval@@: *<seconds>*
    The number of seconds between printing statistics to the log for every
    thread.
    Disable with value ``0`` or ``""``.
    The histogram statistics are only printed if replies were sent during the
    statistics interval, requestlist statistics are printed for every interval
    (but can be 0).
    This is because the median calculation requires data to be present.

    Default: 0 (disabled)


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@statistics-cumulative@@: *<yes or no>*
    If enabled, statistics are cumulative since starting Unbound, without
    clearing the statistics counters after logging the statistics.

    Default: no


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@extended-statistics@@: *<yes or no>*
    If enabled, extended statistics are printed from
    :doc:`unbound-control(8)</manpages/unbound-control>`.
    The counters are listed in
    :doc:`unbound-control(8)</manpages/unbound-control>`.
    Keeping track of more statistics takes time.

    Default: no


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@statistics-inhibit-zero@@: *<yes or no>*
    If enabled, selected extended statistics with a value of 0 are inhibited
    from printing with
    :doc:`unbound-control(8)</manpages/unbound-control>`.
    These are query types, query classes, query opcodes, answer rcodes
    (except NOERROR, FORMERR, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, NOTIMPL, REFUSED)
    and PRZ actions.

    Default: yes


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@num-threads@@: *<number>*
    The number of threads to create to serve clients. Use 1 for no threading.

    Default: 1


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@port@@: *<port number>*
    The port number on which the server responds to queries.

    Default: 53


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@interface@@: *<IP address or interface name[@port]>*
    Interface to use to connect to the network.
    This interface is listened to for queries from clients, and answers to
    clients are given from it.
    Can be given multiple times to work on several interfaces.
    If none are given the default is to listen on localhost.

    If an interface name is used instead of an IP address, the list of IP
    addresses on that interface are used.
    The interfaces are not changed on a reload (``kill -HUP``) but only on
    restart.

    A port number can be specified with @port (without spaces between interface
    and port number), if not specified the default port (from
    :ref:`port<unbound.conf.port>`) is used.


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@ip-address@@: *<IP address or interface name[@port]>*
    Same as :ref:`interface<unbound.conf.interface>` (for ease of
    compatibility with :external+nsd:doc:`manpages/nsd.conf`).


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@interface-automatic@@: *<yes or no>*
    Listen on all addresses on all (current and future) interfaces, detect the
    source interface on UDP queries and copy them to replies.
    This is a lot like :ref:`ip-transparent<unbound.conf.ip-transparent>`, but
    this option services all interfaces whilst with
    :ref:`ip-transparent<unbound.conf.ip-transparent>` you can select which
    (future) interfaces Unbound provides service on.
    This feature is experimental, and needs support in your OS for particular
    socket options.

    Default: no


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@interface-automatic-ports@@: *"<string>"*
    List the port numbers that
    :ref:`interface-automatic<unbound.conf.interface-automatic>` listens on.
    If empty, the default port is listened on.
    The port numbers are separated by spaces in the string.

    This can be used to have interface automatic to deal with the interface,
    and listen on the normal port number, by including it in the list, and
    also HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS port numbers by putting them in the list as
    well.

    Default: ""


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@outgoing-interface@@: *<IPv4/IPv6 address or IPv6 netblock>*
    Interface to use to connect to the network.
    This interface is used to send queries to authoritative servers and receive
    their replies.
    Can be given multiple times to work on several interfaces.
    If none are given the default (all) is used.
    You can specify the same interfaces in
    :ref:`interface<unbound.conf.interface>` and
    :ref:`outgoing-interface<unbound.conf.outgoing-interface>` lines, the
    interfaces are then used for both purposes.
    Outgoing queries are sent via a random outgoing interface to counter
    spoofing.

    If an IPv6 netblock is specified instead of an individual IPv6 address,
    outgoing UDP queries will use a randomised source address taken from the
    netblock to counter spoofing.
    Requires the IPv6 netblock to be routed to the host running Unbound, and
    requires OS support for unprivileged non-local binds (currently only
    supported on Linux).
    Several netblocks may be specified with multiple
    :ref:`outgoing-interface<unbound.conf.outgoing-interface>` options, but do
    not specify both an individual IPv6 address and an IPv6 netblock, or the
    randomisation will be compromised.
    Consider combining with :ref:`prefer-ip6: yes<unbound.conf.prefer-ip6>` to
    increase the likelihood of IPv6 nameservers being selected for queries.
    On Linux you need these two commands to be able to use the freebind socket
    option to receive traffic for the ip6 netblock:

    .. code-block:: text

        ip -6 addr add mynetblock/64 dev lo && \
        ip -6 route add local mynetblock/64 dev lo


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@outgoing-range@@: *<number>*
    Number of ports to open.
    This number of file descriptors can be opened per thread.
    Must be at least 1.
    Default depends on compile options.
    Larger numbers need extra resources from the operating system.
    For performance a very large value is best, use libevent to make this
    possible.

    Default: 4096 (libevent) / 960 (minievent) / 48 (windows)


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@outgoing-port-permit@@: *<port number or range>*
    Permit Unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send queries.
    A larger number of permitted outgoing ports increases resilience against
    spoofing attempts.
    Make sure these ports are not needed by other daemons.
    By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by IANA are
    used.
    Give a port number or a range of the form "low-high", without spaces.

    The :ref:`outgoing-port-permit<unbound.conf.outgoing-port-permit>` and
    :ref:`outgoing-port-avoid<unbound.conf.outgoing-port-avoid>` statements
    are processed in the line order of the config file, adding the permitted
    ports and subtracting the avoided ports from the set of allowed ports.
    The processing starts with the non IANA allocated ports above 1024 in the
    set of allowed ports.


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@outgoing-port-avoid@@: *<port number or range>*
    Do not permit Unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send
    queries.
    Use this to make sure Unbound does not grab a port that another daemon
    needs.
    The port is avoided on all outgoing interfaces, both IPv4 and IPv6.
    By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by IANA are
    used.
    Give a port number or a range of the form "low-high", without spaces.


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@outgoing-num-tcp@@: *<number>*
    Number of outgoing TCP buffers to allocate per thread.
    If set to 0, or if :ref:`do-tcp: no<unbound.conf.do-tcp>` is set, no TCP
    queries to authoritative servers are done.
    For larger installations increasing this value is a good idea.

    Default: 10

    Number of incoming TCP buffers to allocate per thread.
    If set to 0, or if :ref:`do-tcp: no<unbound.conf.do-tcp>` is set, no TCP
    queries from clients are accepted.
    For larger installations increasing this value is a good idea.

@@UAHL@unbound.conf@edns-buffer-size@@: *<number>*
    Number of bytes size to advertise as the EDNS reassembly buffer size.
    This is the value put into datagrams over UDP towards peers.
    The actual buffer size is determined by
    :ref:`msg-buffer-size<unbound.conf.msg-buffer-size>` (both for TCP and
    UDP).
    Do not set higher than that value.
    Setting to 512 bypasses even the most stringent path MTU problems, but is
    seen as extreme, since the amount of TCP fallback generated is excessive
    (probably also for this resolver, consider tuning
    :ref:`outgoing-num-tcp<unbound.conf.outgoing-num-tcp>`).

    Default: 1232 (`DNS Flag Day 2020 recommendation
    <https://dnsflagday.net/2020/>`__)

    Maximum UDP response size (not applied to TCP response).
    65536 disables the UDP response size maximum, and uses the choice from the
    client, always.
    Suggested values are 512 to 4096.

@@UAHL@unbound.conf@stream-wait-size@@: *<number>*
    Number of bytes size maximum to use for waiting stream buffers.
    A plain number is in bytes, append 'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes
    or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).
    As TCP and TLS streams queue up multiple results, the amount of memory used
    for these buffers does not exceed this number, otherwise the responses are
    dropped.
    This manages the total memory usage of the server (under heavy use), the
    number of requests that can be queued up per connection is also limited,
    with further requests waiting in TCP buffers.

    Default: 4m


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@msg-buffer-size@@: *<number>*
    Number of bytes size of the message buffers.
    Default is 65552 bytes, enough for 64 Kb packets, the maximum DNS message
    size.
    No message larger than this can be sent or received.
    Can be reduced to use less memory, but some requests for DNS data, such as
    for huge resource records, will result in a SERVFAIL reply to the client.

    The number of queries that every thread will service simultaneously.
    If more queries arrive that need servicing, and no queries can be jostled
    out (see :ref:`jostle-timeout<unbound.conf.jostle-timeout>`), then the
    queries are dropped.
    This forces the client to resend after a timeout; allowing the server time
    to work on the existing queries.
    Default depends on compile options.

    Default: 2048 (libevent) / 512 (minievent) / 24 (windows)


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@jostle-timeout@@: *<msec>*
    Timeout used when the server is very busy.
    Set to a value that usually results in one roundtrip to the authority
    servers.

    If too many queries arrive, then 50% of the queries are allowed to run to
    completion, and the other 50% are replaced with the new incoming query if
    they have already spent more than their allowed time.
    This protects against denial of service by slow queries or high query
    rates.

    The effect is that the qps for long-lasting queries is about:

    .. code-block:: text

        (num-queries-per-thread / 2) / (average time for such long queries) qps

    The qps for short queries can be about:

    .. code-block:: text

        (num-queries-per-thread / 2) / (jostle-timeout in whole seconds) qps per thread

    about (2048/2)*5 = 5120 qps by default.

    Default: 200


@@UAHL@unbound.conf@delay-close@@: *<msec>*
    Extra delay for timeouted UDP ports before they are closed, in msec.
    This prevents very delayed answer packets from the upstream (recursive)
    servers from bouncing against closed ports and setting off all sort of
    close-port counters, with eg. 1500 msec.
    When timeouts happen you need extra sockets, it checks the ID and remote IP
    of packets, and unwanted packets are added to the unwanted packet counter.

    The wait time in msec for waiting for an unknown server to reply.
    Increase this if you are behind a slow satellite link, to eg. 1128.
    That would then avoid re-querying every initial query because it times out.

    The most specific netblock is used to determine the limit.
    Useful for overriding the default for a specific, group or individual,
    server.
    The value ``-1`` disables wait limits for the netblock.
    By default the loopback has a wait limit netblock of ``-1``, it is not
    limited, because it is separated from the rest of network for spoofed

    On other systems, FreeBSD, OSX it may also work.

    You can enable it (on any platform and kernel), it then attempts to open

    data exists or not in case of local zones, the behavior for
    :ref:`response-ip-data<unbound.conf.response-ip-data>` will generally
    result in NOERROR/NODATA instead of NXDOMAIN, since the
    :ref:`response-ip<unbound.conf.response-ip>` data are inherently type
    specific, and non-existence of data does not indicate anything about the
    existence or non-existence of the qname itself.
    For example, if the matching tag action is static but there is no data for
    the corresponding :ref:`response-ip<unbound.conf.response-ip>`
    configuration, then the result will be NOERROR/NODATA.
    The only case where NXDOMAIN is returned is when an

Stub Zone Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There may be multiple **stub-zone:** clauses.
Each with a :ref:`name<unbound.conf.stub.name>` and zero or more hostnames or
IP addresses.
For the stub zone this list of nameservers is used.
Class IN is assumed.
The servers should be authority servers, not recursors; Unbound performs the
recursive processing itself for stub zones.

The stub zone can be used to configure authoritative data to be used by the
resolver that cannot be accessed using the public internet servers.
This is useful for company-local data or private zones.
Setup an authoritative server on a different host (or different port).
Enter a config entry for Unbound with:

.. code-block:: text

   stub-addr: <ip address of host[@port]>

The Unbound resolver can then access the data, without referring to the public
internet for it.

This setup allows DNSSEC signed zones to be served by that authoritative
server, in which case a trusted key entry with the public key can be put in
config, so that Unbound can validate the data and set the AD bit on replies for
the private zone (authoritative servers do not set the AD bit).
This setup makes Unbound capable of answering queries for the private zone, and
can even set the AD bit ('authentic'), but the AA ('authoritative') bit is not
set on these replies.

Consider adding :ref:`server<unbound.conf.server>` statements for
:ref:`domain-insecure<unbound.conf.domain-insecure>` and for
:ref:`local-zone: \<name\> nodefault<unbound.conf.local-zone.type.nodefault>`

The insecure clause stops DNSSEC from invalidating the zone.
The :ref:`local-zone: nodefault<unbound.conf.local-zone.type.nodefault>` (or
:ref:`transparent<unbound.conf.local-zone.type.transparent>`) clause makes the
(reverse-) zone bypass Unbound's filtering of :rfc:`1918` zones.

further recursion for the query.
Thus, those servers are not authority servers, but are (just like Unbound is)
recursive servers too; Unbound does not perform recursion itself for the
forward zone, it lets the remote server do it.
Class IN is assumed.
CNAMEs are chased by Unbound itself, asking the remote server for every name in
the indirection chain, to protect the local cache from illegal indirect
referenced items.
A :ref:`forward-zone<unbound.conf.forward>` entry with name

.. _unbound.conf.auth:

Authority Zone Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authority zones are configured with **auth-zone:**, and each one must have a
:ref:`name<unbound.conf.auth.name>`.
There can be multiple ones, by listing multiple auth-zone clauses, each with a
different name, pertaining to that part of the namespace.
The authority zone with the name closest to the name looked up is used.
Authority zones can be processed on two distinct, non-exclusive, configurable
stages.

With :ref:`for-downstream: yes<unbound.conf.auth.for-downstream>` (default),
authority zones are processed after **local-zones** and before cache.
When used in this manner, Unbound responds like an authority server with no
further processing other than returning an answer from the zone contents.
A notable example, in this case, is CNAME records which are returned verbatim
to downstream clients without further resolution.

With :ref:`for-upstream: yes<unbound.conf.auth.for-upstream>` (default),
authority zones are processed after the cache lookup, just before going to the
network to fetch information for recursion.
When used in this manner they provide a local copy of an authority server
that speeds up lookups for that data during resolving.

If both options are enabled (default), client queries for an authority zone are
answered authoritatively from Unbound, while internal queries that require data
from the authority zone consult the local zone data instead of going to the
network.

An interesting configuration is
:ref:`for-downstream: no<unbound.conf.auth.for-downstream>`,
:ref:`for-upstream: yes<unbound.conf.auth.for-upstream>`
that allows for hyperlocal behavior where both client and internal queries
consult the local zone data while resolving.
In this case, the aforementioned CNAME example will result in a thoroughly
resolved answer.

Authority zones can be read from zonefile.
And can be kept updated via AXFR and IXFR.
After update the zonefile is rewritten.
The update mechanism uses the SOA timer values and performs SOA UDP queries to
detect zone changes.

If the update fetch fails, the timers in the SOA record are used to time
another fetch attempt.
Until the SOA expiry timer is reached.
Then the zone is expired.
When a zone is expired, queries are SERVFAIL, and any new serial number is
accepted from the primary (even if older), and if fallback is enabled, the
fallback activates to fetch from the upstream instead of the SERVFAIL.

    They are all tried if one fails.

    To use a non-default port for DNS communication append ``'@'`` with the

    You can append a ``'#'`` and a name, then AXFR over TLS can be used and the

    If you combine the ``'@'`` and ``'#'``, the ``'@'`` comes first.

    from a webserver that would work.

    Multiple url statements can be given, they are tried in turn.

    If only urls are given the SOA refresh timer is used to wait for making new

    If none of the urls work, the primaries are tried with IXFR and AXFR.

    For HTTPS, the :ref:`tls-cert-bundle<unbound.conf.tls-cert-bundle>` and

Python Module Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **python:** clause gives the settings for the *python(1)* script module.
This module acts like the iterator and validator modules do, on queries and
answers.
To enable the script module it has to be compiled into the daemon, and the word
``python`` has to be put in the
:ref:`module-config<unbound.conf.module-config>` option (usually first, or
between the validator and iterator).
Multiple instances of the python module are supported by adding the word
``python`` more than once.

If the :ref:`chroot<unbound.conf.chroot>` option is enabled, you should make
sure Python's library directory structure is bind mounted in the new root

The **dynlib:** clause gives the settings for the ``dynlib`` module.
This module is only a very small wrapper that allows dynamic modules to be
loaded on runtime instead of being compiled into the application.
To enable the dynlib module it has to be compiled into the daemon, and the word

DNSCrypt Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **dnscrypt:** clause gives the settings of the dnscrypt channel.
While those options are available, they are only meaningful if Unbound was
compiled with ``--enable-dnscrypt``.

    Likewise, it would allow one to prime the new cert/key without distributing
    the new cert yet, this can be useful when using a network of servers using
    anycast and on which the configuration may not get updated at the exact

EDNS Client Subnet Module Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ECS module must be configured in the
:ref:`module-config<unbound.conf.module-config>` directive, e.g.:

.. code-block:: text

    module-config: "subnetcache validator iterator"

and be compiled into the daemon to be enabled.

.. note::
    These settings go in the :ref:`server:<unbound.conf.server>` section.

If the destination address is allowed in the configuration Unbound will add the
EDNS0 option to the query containing the relevant part of the client's address.
When an answer contains the ECS option the response and the option are placed
in a specialized cache.
If the authority indicated no support, the response is stored in the regular
cache.

Additionally, when a client includes the option in its queries, Unbound will
forward the option when sending the query to addresses that are explicitly
allowed in the configuration using
:ref:`send-client-subnet<unbound.conf.ecs.send-client-subnet>`.
The option will always be forwarded, regardless the allowed addresses, when
:ref:`client-subnet-always-forward: yes<unbound.conf.ecs.client-subnet-always-forward>`
is set.
In this case the lookup in the regular cache is skipped.

The maximum size of the ECS cache is controlled by
:ref:`msg-cache-size<unbound.conf.msg-cache-size>` in the configuration file.
On top of that, for each query only 100 different subnets are allowed to be
stored for each address family.
Exceeding that number, older entries will be purged from cache.

Note that due to the nature of how EDNS Client Subnet works, by segregating the
client IP space in order to try and have tailored responses for prefixes of
unknown sizes, resolution and cache response performance are impacted as a
result.
Usage of the subnetcache module should only be enabled in installations that
require such functionality where the resolver and the clients belong to
different networks.
An example of that is an open resolver installation.

Opportunistic IPsec Support Module Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IPsec module must be configured in the
:ref:`module-config<unbound.conf.module-config>` directive, e.g.:

.. code-block:: text

    module-config: "ipsecmod validator iterator"

and be compiled into Unbound by using ``--enable-ipsecmod`` to be enabled.

.. note::
    These settings go in the :ref:`server:<unbound.conf.server>` section.

When Unbound receives an A/AAAA query that is not in the cache and finds a
valid answer, it will withhold returning the answer and instead will generate
an IPSECKEY subquery for the same domain name.
If an answer was found, Unbound will call an external hook passing the
following arguments:

QNAME
    Domain name of the A/AAAA and IPSECKEY query.
    In string format.

IPSECKEY TTL
    TTL of the IPSECKEY RRset.

A/AAAA
    String of space separated IP addresses present in the A/AAAA RRset.
    The IP addresses are in string format.

IPSECKEY
    String of space separated IPSECKEY RDATA present in the IPSECKEY RRset.
    The IPSECKEY RDATA are in DNS presentation format.

The A/AAAA answer is then cached and returned to the client.
If the external hook was called the TTL changes to ensure it doesn't surpass
:ref:`ipsecmod-max-ttl<unbound.conf.ipsecmod-max-ttl>`.

The same procedure is also followed when
:ref:`prefetch: yes<unbound.conf.prefetch>` is set, but the A/AAAA answer is
given to the client before the hook is called.
:ref:`ipsecmod-max-ttl<unbound.conf.ipsecmod-max-ttl>` ensures that the A/AAAA
answer given from cache is still relevant for opportunistic IPsec.

Cache DB Module Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Cache DB module must be configured in the
:ref:`module-config<unbound.conf.module-config>` directive, e.g.:

.. code-block:: text

    module-config: "validator cachedb iterator"

and be compiled into the daemon with ``--enable-cachedb``.

If this module is enabled and configured, the specified backend database works
as a second level cache; when Unbound cannot find an answer to a query in its
built-in in-memory cache, it consults the specified backend.
If it finds a valid answer in the backend, Unbound uses it to respond to the
query without performing iterative DNS resolution.
If Unbound cannot even find an answer in the backend, it resolves the query as
usual, and stores the answer in the backend.

This module interacts with the *serve-expired-\** options and will reply with
expired data if Unbound is configured for that.

If Unbound was built with ``--with-libhiredis`` on a system that has installed
the hiredis C client library of Redis, then the ``redis`` backend can be used.
This backend communicates with the specified Redis server over a TCP connection
to store and retrieve cache data.
It can be used as a persistent and/or shared cache backend.

.. note::
    Unbound never removes data stored in the Redis server, even if some data
    have expired in terms of DNS TTL or the Redis server has cached too much
    data; if necessary the Redis server must be configured to limit the cache
    size, preferably with some kind of least-recently-used eviction policy.

Additionally, the
:ref:`redis-expire-records<unbound.conf.cachedb.redis-expire-records>` option
can be used in order to set the relative DNS TTL of the message as timeout to
the Redis records; keep in mind that some additional memory is used per key and
that the expire information is stored as absolute Unix timestamps in Redis
(computer time must be stable).

This backend uses synchronous communication with the Redis server based on the
assumption that the communication is stable and sufficiently fast.
The thread waiting for a response from the Redis server cannot handle other DNS
queries.
Although the backend has the ability to reconnect to the server when the
connection is closed unexpectedly and there is a configurable timeout in case
the server is overly slow or hangs up, these cases are assumed to be very rare.
If connection close or timeout happens too often, Unbound will be effectively
unusable with this backend.
It's the administrator's responsibility to make the assumption hold.

.. _unbound.conf.rpz:

Response Policy Zone Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Response Policy Zones are configured with **rpz:**, and each one must have a
:ref:`name<unbound.conf.rpz.name>` attribute.
There can be multiple ones, by listing multiple RPZ clauses, each with a
different name.
RPZ clauses are applied in order of configuration and any match from an earlier
RPZ zone will terminate the RPZ lookup.
Note that a PASSTHRU action is still considered a match.
The respip module needs to be added to the
:ref:`module-config<unbound.conf.module-config>`, e.g.:

.. code-block:: text

    module-config: "respip validator iterator"

QNAME, Response IP Address, nsdname, nsip and clientip triggers are supported.
Supported actions are: NXDOMAIN, NODATA, PASSTHRU, DROP, Local Data, tcp-only
and drop.
RPZ QNAME triggers are applied after any
:ref:`local-zone<unbound.conf.local-zone>` and before any
:ref:`auth-zone<unbound.conf.auth>`.

The RPZ zone is a regular DNS zone formatted with a SOA start record as usual.
The items in the zone are entries, that specify what to act on (the trigger)
and what to do (the action).
The trigger to act on is recorded in the name, the action to do is recorded as
the resource record.
The names all end in the zone name, so you could type the trigger names without
a trailing dot in the zonefile.

An example RPZ record, that answers ``example.com`` with ``NXDOMAIN``:

.. code-block:: text

    example.com CNAME .

The triggers are encoded in the name on the left

.. code-block:: text

    name                          query name
    netblock.rpz-client-ip        client IP address
    netblock.rpz-ip               response IP address in the answer
    name.rpz-nsdname              nameserver name
    netblock.rpz-nsip             nameserver IP address

The netblock is written as ``<netblocklen>.<ip address in reverse>``.
For IPv6 use ``'zz'`` for ``'::'``.
Specify individual addresses with scope length of 32 or 128.
For example, ``24.10.100.51.198.rpz-ip`` is ``198.51.100.10/24`` and
``32.10.zz.db8.2001.rpz-ip`` is ``2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:10/32``.

The actions are specified with the record on the right

.. code-block:: text

    CNAME .                      nxdomain reply
    CNAME *.                     nodata reply
    CNAME rpz-passthru.          do nothing, allow to continue
    CNAME rpz-drop.              the query is dropped
    CNAME rpz-tcp-only.          answer over TCP
    A 192.0.2.1                  answer with this IP address

Other records like AAAA, TXT and other CNAMEs (not rpz-..) can also be used to
answer queries with that content.

The RPZ zones can be configured in the config file with these settings in the
**rpz:** block.

    Multiple primaries can be specified.
    They are all tried if one fails.

    To use a non-default port for DNS communication append ``'@'`` with the
    port number.

    You can append a ``'#'`` and a name, then AXFR over TLS can be used and the
    TLS authentication certificates will be checked with that name.

    If you combine the ``'@'`` and ``'#'``, the ``'@'`` comes first.
    If you point it at another Unbound instance, it would not work because that
    does not support AXFR/IXFR for the zone, but if you used
    :ref:`url<unbound.conf.rpz.url>` to download the zonefile as a text file
    from a webserver that would work.

    If you specify the hostname, you cannot use the domain from the zonefile,
    because it may not have that when retrieving that data, instead use a plain
    IP address to avoid a circular dependency on retrieving that IP address.

    Multiple url statements can be given, they are tried in turn.

    If only urls are given the SOA refresh timer is used to wait for making new
    downloads.
    If also primaries are listed, the primaries are first probed with UDP SOA
    queries to see if the SOA serial number has changed, reducing the number of
    downloads.
    If none of the URLs work, the primaries are tried with IXFR and AXFR.

Memory Control Example
----------------------

In the example config settings below memory usage is reduced.
Some service levels are lower, notable very large data and a high TCP load are
no longer supported.
Very large data and high TCP loads are exceptional for the DNS.
DNSSEC validation is enabled, just add trust anchors.
If you do not have to worry about programs using more than 3 Mb of memory, the
below example is not for you.
Use the defaults to receive full service, which on BSD-32bit tops out at 30-40
Mb after heavy usage.
