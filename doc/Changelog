		* includes tpkg fixes to kill daemons at end of test
		* includes NSEC/RRSIG not downcasing fixup from
		dnssec-bis-updates draft-06.
		* README file updated.
		* nice libevent not found error.
		* README talks about gnu make.
	- for 0.7.2:
		* fixup for donotq matching.

15 November 2007: Wouter
	- review fixups from Jelte.

14 November 2007: Wouter
	- testbed script does not recreate configure, since its in svn now.
	- fixup checkconf test so that it does not test 
	  /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
	- tag 0.6.

13 November 2007: Wouter
	- remove debug print.
	- fixup testbound exit when LIBEVENT_SIGNAL_PROBLEM exists.

12 November 2007: Wouter
	- fixup signal handling where SIGTERM could be ignored if a SIGHUP
	  arrives later on.
	- bugreports to unbound-bugs@nlnetlabs.nl
	- fixup testbound so it exits cleanly.
	- cleanup the caches on a reload, so that rrsetID numbers won't clash.

9 November 2007: Wouter
	- took ldns snapshot in repo.
	- default config file is /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
	  If it doesn't exist, it is installed with the doc/example.conf file.
	  The file is not deleted on uninstall.
	- default listening is not all, but localhost interfaces.
	
8 November 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup chroot and drop user privileges.
	- new L root ip address in default hints.

1 November 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup of crash on reload, due to anchors in env not NULLed after
	  dealloc during deinit.
	- Fixup of chroot call. Happens after privileges are dropped, so
	  that checking the passwd entry still works.
	- minor touch up of clear() hashtable function.
	- VERB_DETAIL prints out what chdir, username, chroot is being done.
	- when id numbers run out, caches are cleared, as in design notes.
	  Tested with a mock setup with very few bits in id, it worked.
	- harden-dnssec-stripped: yes is now default. It insists on dnssec
	  data for trust anchors. Included tests for the feature.

31 October 2007: Wouter
	- cache-max-ttl config option.
	- building outside sourcedir works again.
	- defaults more secure:
		username: "unbound"
		chroot: "/etc/unbound"
	  The operator can override them to be less secure ("") if necessary.
	- fix horrible oversight in sorting rrset references in a message,
	  sort per reference key pointer, not on referencepointer itself.
	- pidfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.pid" is now the default.
	- tests changed to reflect the updated default.
	- created hashtable clear() function that respects locks.

30 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup assertion failure that relied on compressed names to be
	  smaller than uncompressed names. A packet from comrite.com was seen
	  to be compressed to a larger size. Added it as unit test.
	- quieter logging at low verbosity level for common tcp messages.
	- no greedy TTL update.

23 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup (grand-)parent problem for dnssec-lameness detection.
	- fixup tests to do additional section processing for lame replies,
	  since the detection needs that.
	- no longer trust in query section in reply during dnssec lame detect.
	- dnssec lameness does not make the server never ever queried, but
	  non-preferred. If no other servers exist or answer, the dnssec lame
	  server is used; the fastest dnssec lame server is chosen.
	- added test then when trust anchor cannot be primed (nodata), the
	  insecure mode from unbound works.
	- Fixup max queries per thread, any more are dropped.

22 October 2007: Wouter
	- added donotquerylocalhost config option. Can be turned off for
	  out test cases.
	- ISO C compat changes.
	- detect RA-no-AA lameness, as LAME.
	- DNSSEC-lameness detection, as LAME.
	  See notes in requirements.txt for choices made.
	- tests for lameness detection.
	- added all to make test target; need unbound for fwd tests.
	- testbound does not pollute /etc/unbound.

19 October 2007: Wouter
	- added configure (and its files) to svn, so that the trunk is easier
	  to use. ./configure, config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh,
	  and config.h.in.
	- added yacc/lex generated files, util/configlexer.c, 
	  util/configparser.c util/configparser.h, to svn. 
	- without lex no attempt to use it.
	- unsecure response validation collated into one block.
	- remove warning about const cast of cfgfile name.
	- outgoing-interfaces can be different from service interfaces.
	- ldns-src configure is done during unbound configure and
	  ldns-src make is done during unbound make, and so inherits the
	  make arguments from the unbound make invocation.
	- nicer error when libevent problem causes instant exit on signal.
	- read root hints from a root hint file (like BIND does).
	  
18 October 2007: Wouter
	- addresses are logged with errors.
	- fixup testcode fake event to remove pending before callback
	  since the callback may create new pending items.
	- tests updated because retries are now in iterator module.
	- ldns-testpkts code is checked for differences between unbound
	  and ldns by makedist.sh.
	- ldns trunk from today added in svn repo for fallback in case
	  no ldns is installed on the system.
	  make download_ldns refreshes the tarball with ldns svn trunk.
	- ldns-src.tar.gz is used if no ldns is found on the system, and
	  statically linked into unbound.
	- start of regional allocator code.
	- regional uses less memory and variables, simplified code.
	- remove of region-allocator.
	- alloc cache keeps a cache of recently released regional blocks,
	  up to a maximum.
	- make unit test cleanly free memory.

17 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup another cycle detect and ns-addr timeout resolution bug.
	  This time by refusing delegations from the cache without addresses
	  when resolving a mandatory-glue nameserver-address for that zone.
	  We're going to have to ask a TLD server anyway; might as well be
	  the TLD server for this name. And this resolves a lot of cases where
	  the other nameserver names lead to cycles or are not available.
	- changed random generator from random(3) clone to arc4random wrapped
	  for thread safety. The random generator is initialised with
	  entropy from the system.
	- fix crash where failure to prime DNSKEY tried to print null pointer
	  in the log message.
	- removed some debug prints, only verb_algo (4) enables them.
	- fixup test; new random generator took new paths; such as one 
	  where no scripted answer was available.
	- mark insecure RRs as insecure.
	- fixup removal of nonsecure items from the additional.
	- reduced timeout values to more realistic, 376 msec (262 msec has
	  90% of roundtrip times, 512 msec has 99% of roundtrip times.)
	- server selection failover to next server after timeout (376 msec).

16 October 2007: Wouter
	- no malloc in log_hex.
	- assertions around system calls.
	- protect against gethostname without ending zero.
	- ntop output is null terminated by unbound.
	- pidfile content null termination
	- various snprintf use sizeof(stringbuf) instead of fixed constant.
	- changed loopdetect % 8 with & 0x7 since % can become negative for
	  weird negative input and particular interpretation of integer math.
	- dname_pkt_copy checks length of result, to protect result buffers.
	  prints an error, this should not happen. Bad strings should have
	  been rejected earlier in the program.
	- remove a size_t underflow from msgreply size func.

15 October 2007: Wouter
	- nicer warning.
	- fix IP6 TCP, wrong definition check. With test package.
	- fixup the fact that the query section was not compressed to,
	  the code was there but was called by value instead of by reference.
	  And test for the case, uses xxd and nc.
	- more portable ip6 check for sockaddr types.

8 October 2007: Wouter
	- --disable-rpath option in configure for 64bit systems with
	  several dynamic lib dirs.

7 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup tests for no AD bit in non-DO queries.
	- test that makes sure AD bit is not set on non-DO query.

6 October 2007: Wouter
	- removed logfile open early. It did not have the proper permissions;
	  it was opened as root instead of the user. And we cannot change user
	  id yet, since chroot and bind ports need to be done.
	- callback checks for event callbacks done from mini_event. Because
	  of deletions cannot do this from netevent. This means when using
	  libevent the protection does not work on event-callbacks.
	- fixup too small reply (did not zero counts).
	- fixup reply no longer AD bit when query without DO bit.

5 October 2007: Wouter
	- function pointer whitelist.

4 October 2007: Wouter
	- overwrite sensitive random seed value after use.
	- switch to logfile very soon if not -d (console attached).
	- error messages do not reveal the trustanchor contents.
	- start work on function pointer whitelists.

3 October 2007: Wouter
	- fix for multiple empty nonterminals, after multiple DSes in the
	  chain of trust.
	- mesh checks if modules are looping, and stops them.
	- refetch with CNAMEd nameserver address regression test added.
	- fixup line count bug in testcode, so testbound prints correct line
	  number with parse errors.
	- unit test for multiple ENT case.
	- fix for cname out of validated unsec zone.
	- fixup nasty id=0 reuse. Also added assertions to detect its
	  return (the assertion catches in the existing test cases).

1 October 2007: Wouter
	- skip F77, CXX, objC tests in configure step.
	- fixup crash in refetch glue after a CNAME.
	  and protection against similar failures (with error print).

28 September 2007: Wouter
	- test case for unbound-checkconf, fixed so it also checks the
	  interface: statements.

26 September 2007: Wouter
	- SIGHUP will reopen the log file.
	- Option to log to syslog.
	- please lint, fixup tests (that went to syslog on open, oops).
	- config check program.

25 September 2007: Wouter
	- tests for NSEC3. Fixup bitmap checks for NSEC3.
	- positive ANY response needs to check if wildcard expansion, and
	  check that original data did not exist.
	- tests for NSEC3 that wrong use of OPTOUT is bad. For insecure
	  delegation, for abuse of child zone apex nsec3.
	- create 0.5 release tag.

24 September 2007: Wouter
	- do not make test programs by default.
	- But 'make test' will perform all of the tests.
	- Advertise builtin select libevent alternative when no libevent
	  is found.
	- signit can generate NSEC3 hashes, for generating tests.
	- multiple nsec3 paramaters in message test.
	- too high nsec3 iterations becomes insecure test.

21 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup empty_DS_name allocated in wrong region (port DEC Alpha).
	- fixup testcode lock safety (port FreeBSD).
	- removes subscript has type char warnings (port Solaris 9).
	- fixup of field with format type to int (port MacOS/X intel).
	- added test for infinite loop case in nonRD answer validation.
	  It was a more general problem, but hard to reproduce. When an
	  unsigned rrset is being validated and the key fetched, the DS
	  sequence is followed, but if the final name has no DS, then no
	  proof is possible - the signature has been stripped off.

20 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup and test for NSEC wildcard with empty nonterminals. 
	- makedist.sh fixup for svn info.
	- acl features request in plan.
	- improved DS empty nonterminal handling.
	- compat with ANS nxdomain for empty nonterminals. Attempts the nodata
	  proof anyway, which succeeds in ANS failure case.
	- striplab protection in case it becomes -1.
	- plans for static and blacklist config.

19 September 2007: Wouter
	- comments about non-packed usage.
	- plan for overload support in 0.6.
	- added testbound tests for a failed resolution from the logs
	  and for failed prime when missing glue.
	- fixup so useless delegation points are not returned from the
	  cache. Also the safety belt is used if priming fails to complete.
	- fixup NSEC rdata not to be lowercased, bind compat.

18 September 2007: Wouter
	- wildcard nsec3 testcases, and fixup to get correct wildcard name.
	- validator prints subtype classification for debug.

17 September 2007: Wouter
	- NSEC3 hash cache unit test.
	- validator nsec3 nameerror test.

14 September 2007: Wouter
	- nsec3 nodata proof, nods proof, wildcard proof.
	- nsec3 support for cname chain ending in noerror or nodata.
	- validator calls nsec3 proof routines if no NSECs prove anything.
	- fixup iterator bug where it stored the answer to a cname under
	  the wrong qname into the cache. When prepending the cnames, the
	  qname has to be reset to the original qname.

13 September 2007: Wouter
	- nsec3 find matching and covering, ce proof, prove namerror msg.

12 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup of manual page warnings, like for NSD bugreport.
	- nsec3 work, config, max iterations, filter, and hash cache. 

6 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup to find libevent on mac port install.
	- fixup size_t vs unsigned portability in validator/sigcrypt.
	- please compiler on different platforms, for unreachable code.
	- val_nsec3 file.
	- pthread_rwlock type is optional, in case of old pthread libs.

5 September 2007: Wouter
	- cname, name error validator tests.
	- logging of qtype ANY works.
	- ANY type answers get RRSIG in answer section of replies (but not
	  in other sections, unless DO bit is on).
	- testbound can replay a TCP query (set MATCH TCP in the QUERY).
	- DS and noDS referral validation test.
	- if you configure many trust anchors, parent trust anchors can
	  securely deny existance of child trust anchors, if validated.
	- not all *.name NSECs are present because a wildcard was matched,
	  and *.name NSECs can prove nodata for empty nonterminals.
	  Also, for wildcard name NSECs, check they are not from the parent
	  zone (for wildcarded zone cuts), and check absence of CNAME bit,
	  for a nodata proof.
	- configure option for memory allocation debugging.
	- port configure option for memory allocation to solaris10.

4 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup of Leakage warning when serviced queries processed multiple
	  callbacks for the same query from the same server.
	- testbound removes config file from /tmp on failed exit.
	- fixup for referral cleanup of the additional section.
	- tests for cname, referral validation.
	- neater testbound tpkg output.
	- DNAMEs no longer match their apex when synthesized from the cache.
	- find correct signer name for DNAME responses.
	- wildcarded DNAME test and fixup code to detect.
	- prepend NSEC and NSEC3 rrsets in the iterator while chasing CNAMEs.
	  So that wildcarded CNAMEs get their NSEC with them to the answer.
	- test for a CNAME to a DNAME to a CNAME to an answer, all from
	  different domains, for key fetching and signature checking of
	  CNAME'd messages.

3 September 2007: Wouter
	- Fixed error in iterator that would cause assertion failure in 
	  validator. CNAME to a NXDOMAIN response was collated into a response
	  with both a CNAME and the NXDOMAIN rcode. Added a test that the
	  rcode is changed to NOERROR (because of the CNAME).
	- timeout on tcp does not lead to spurious leakage detect.
	- account memory for name of lame zones, so that memory leakages does
	  not show lame cache growth as a leakage growth.
	- config setting for lameness cache expressed in bytes, instead of
	  number of entries.
	- tool too summarize allocations per code line.

31 August 2007: Wouter
	- can read bind trusted-keys { ... }; files, in a compatibility mode. 
	- iterator should not detach target queries that it still could need.
	  the protection against multiple outstanding queries is moved to a
	  current_query num check.
	- validator nodata, positive, referral tests.
	- dname print can print '*' wildcard.

30 August 2007: Wouter
	- fixup override date config option.
	- config options to control memory usage.
	- caught bad free of un-alloced data in worker_send error case.
	- memory accounting for key cache (trust anchors and temporary cache).
	- memory accounting fixup for outside network tcp pending waits.
	- memory accounting fixup for outside network tcp callbacks.
	- memory accounting for iterator fixed storage.
	- key cache size and slabs config options.
	- lib crypto cleanups at exit. 

29 August 2007: Wouter
	- test tool to sign rrsets for testing validator with.
	- added RSA and DSA test keys, public and private pairs, 512 bits.
	- default configuration is with validation enabled.
	  Only a trust-anchor needs to be configured for DNSSEC to work.
	- do not convert to DER for DSA signature verification.
	- validator replay test file, for a DS to DNSKEY DSA key prime and
	  positive response.

28 August 2007: Wouter
	- removed double use for udp buffers, that could fail,
	  instead performs a malloc to do the backup.
	- validator validates referral messages, by validating all the rrsets
	  and stores the rrsets in the cache. Further referral (nonRD queries)
	  replies are made from the rrset cache directly. Unless unchecked
	  rrsets are encountered, there are then validated.
	- enforce that signing is done by a parent domain (or same domain).
	- adjust TTL downwards if rrset TTL bigger than signature allows.
	- permissive mode feature, sets AD bit for secure, but bogus does
	  not give servfail (bogus is changed into indeterminate).
	- optimization of rrset verification. rr canonical sorting is reused,
	  for the same rrset. canonical rrset image in buffer is reused for
	  the same signature.
	- if the rrset is too big (64k exactly + large owner name) the
	  canonicalization routine will fail if it does not fit in buffer.
	- faster verification for large sigsets.
	- verb_detail mode reports validation failures, but not the entire
	  algorithm for validation. Key prime failures are reported as 
	  verb_ops level.

27 August 2007: Wouter
	- do not garble the edns if a cache answer fails.
	- answer norecursive from cache if possible.
	- honor clean_additional setting when returning secure non-recursive
	  referrals.
	- do not store referral in msg cache for nonRD queries.
	- store verification status in the rrset cache to speed up future
	  verification.
	- mark rrsets indeterminate and insecure if they are found to be so.
	  and store this in the cache.

24 August 2007: Wouter
	- message is bogus if unsecure authority rrsets are present.
	- val-clean-additional option, so you can turn it off.
	- move rrset verification out of the specific proof types into one
	  routine. This makes the proof routines prettier.
	- fixup cname handling in validator, cname-to-positive and cname-to-
	  nodata work.
	- Do not synthesize DNSKEY and DS responses from the rrset cache if
	  the rrset is from the additional section. Signatures may have
	  fallen off the packet, and cause validation failure.
	- more verbose signature date errors (with the date attached).
	- increased default infrastructure cache size. It is important for
	  performance, and 1000 entries are only 212k (or a 400 k total cache
	  size). To 10000 entries (for 2M entries, 4M cache size).

23 August 2007: Wouter
	- CNAME handling - move needs_validation to before val_new().
	  val_new() setups the chase-reply to be an edited copy of the msg.
	  new classification, and find signer can find for it. 
	  removal of unsigned crap from additional, and query restart for
	  cname.
	- refuse to follow wildcarded DNAMEs when validating.
	  But you can query for qtype ANY, or qtype DNAME and validate that.

22 August 2007: Wouter
	- bogus TTL.
	- review - use val_error().

21 August 2007: Wouter
	- ANY response validation.
	- store security status in cache.
	- check cache security status and either send the query to be
	  validated, return the query to client, or send servfail to client.
	  Sets AD bit on validated replies.
	- do not examine security status on an error reply in mesh_done.
	- construct DS, DNSKEY messages from rrset cache.
	- manual page entry for override-date.

20 August 2007: Wouter
	- validate and positive validation, positive wildcard NSEC validation.
	- nodata validation, nxdomain validation.

18 August 2007: Wouter
	- process DNSKEY response in FINDKEY state.

17 August 2007: Wouter
	- work on DS2KE routine.
	- val_nsec.c for validator NSEC proofs.
	- unit test for NSEC bitmap reading.
	- dname iswild and canonical_compare with unit tests.

16 August 2007: Wouter
	- DS sig unit test.
	- latest release libevent 1.3c and 1.3d have threading fixed.
	- key entry fixup data pointer and ttl absolute.
	- This makes a key-prime succeed in validator, with DS or DNSKEY as
	  trust-anchor.
	- fixup canonical compare byfield routine, fix bug and also neater.
	- fixed iterator response type classification for queries of type
	  ANY and NS.
	  dig ANY gives sometimes NS rrset in AN and NS section, and parser
	  removes the NS section duplicate. dig NS gives sometimes the NS
	  in the answer section, as referral.
	- validator FINDKEY state.

15 August 2007: Wouter
	- crypto calls to verify signatures.
	- unit test for rrsig verification.

14 August 2007: Wouter
	- default outgoing ports changed to avoid port 2049 by default.
	  This port is widely blocked by firewalls.
	- count infra lameness cache in memory size.
	- accounting of memory improved
	- outbound entries are allocated in the query region they are for.
	- extensive debugging for memory allocations.
	- --enable-lock-checks can be used to enable lock checking.
	- protect undefs in config.h from autoheaders ministrations.
	- print all received udp packets. log hex will print on multiple
	  lines if needed.
	- fixed error in parser with backwards rrsig references.
	- mark cycle targets for iterator did not have CD flag so failed
	  its task.

13 August 2007: Wouter
	- fixup makefile, if lexer is missing give nice error and do not
	  mess up the dependencies.
	- canonical compare routine updated.
	- canonical hinfo compare.
	- printout list of the queries that the mesh is working on.

10 August 2007: Wouter
	- malloc and free overrides that track total allocation and frees.
	  for memory debugging.
	- work on canonical sort.

9 August 2007: Wouter
	- canonicalization, signature checks
	- dname signature label count and unit test.
	- added debug heap size print to memory printout.
	- typo fixup in worker.c
	- -R needed on solaris.
	- validator override option for date check testing.

8 August 2007: Wouter
	- ldns _raw routines created (in ldns trunk).
	- sigcrypt DS digest routines
	- val_utils uses sigcrypt to perform signature cryptography.
	- sigcrypt keyset processing

7 August 2007: Wouter
	- security status type.
	- security status is copied when rdata is equal for rrsets.
	- rrset id is updated to invalidate all the message cache entries
	  that refer to NSEC, NSEC3, DNAME rrsets that have changed.
	- val_util work
	- val_sigcrypt file for validator signature checks.

6 August 2007: Wouter
	- key cache for validator.
	- moved isroot and dellabel to own dname routines, with unit test.

3 August 2007: Wouter
	- replanning.
	- scrubber check section of lame NS set.
	- trust anchors can be in config file or read from zone file,
	  DS and DNSKEY entries.
	- unit test trust anchor storage.
	- trust anchors converted to packed rrsets.
	- key entry definition.

2 August 2007: Wouter
	- configure change for latest libevent trunk version (needs -lrt).
	- query_done and walk_supers are moved out of module interface.
	- fixup delegation point duplicates.
	- fixup iterator scrubber; lame NS set is let through the scrubber
	  so that the classification is lame.
	- validator module exists, and does nothing but pass through,
	  with calling of next module and return.
	- validator work.

1 August 2007: Wouter
	- set version to 0.5
	- module work for module to module interconnections.
	- config of modules.
	- detect cycle takes flags.

31 July 2007: Wouter
	- updated plan
	- release 0.4 tag.

30 July 2007: Wouter
	- changed random state init, so that sequential process IDs are not
	  cancelled out by sequential thread-ids in the random number seed.
	- the fwd_three test, which sends three queries to unbound, and 
	  unbound is kept waiting by ldns-testns for 3 seconds, failed
	  because the retry timeout for default by unbound is 3 seconds too,
	  it would hit that timeout and fail the test. Changed so that unbound
	  is kept waiting for 2 seconds instead.

27 July 2007: Wouter
	- removed useless -C debug option. It did not work.
	- text edit of documentation.
	- added doc/CREDITS file, referred to by the manpages.
	- updated planning.

26 July 2007: Wouter
	- cycle detection, for query state dependencies. Will attempt to
	  circumvent the cycle, but if no other targets available fails.
	- unit test for AXFR, IXFR response.
	- test for cycle detection.

25 July 2007: Wouter
	- testbound read ADDRESS and check it.
	- test for version.bind and friends.
	- test for iterator chaining through several referrals.
	- test and fixup for refetch for glue. Refetch fails if glue
	  is still not provided.

24 July 2007: Wouter
	- Example section in config manual.
	- Addr stored for range and moment in replay.

20 July 2007: Wouter
	- Check CNAME chain before returning cache entry with CNAMEs.
	- Option harden-glue, default is on. It will discard out of zone
	  data. If disabled, performance is faster, but spoofing attempts
	  become a possibility. Note that still normalize scrubbing is done,
	  and that the potentially spoofed data is used for infrastructure
	  and not returned to the client.
	- if glue times out, refetch by asking parent of delegation again.
	  Much like asking for DS at the parent side.
	- TODO items from forgery-resilience draft.
	  and on memory handling improvements.
	- renamed module_event_timeout to module_event_noreply.
	- memory reporting code; reports on memory usage after handling
	  a network packet (not on cache replies).

19 July 2007: Wouter
	- shuffle NS selection when getting nameserver target addresses.
	- fixup of deadlock warnings, yield cpu in checklock code so that
	  freebsd scheduler selects correct process to run.
	- added identity and version config options and replies.
	- store cname messages complete answers.

18 July 2007: Wouter
	- do not query addresses, 127.0.0.1, and ::1 by default.

17 July 2007: Wouter
	- forward zone options in config file.
	- forward per zone in iterator. takes precendence over stubs.
	- fixup commithooks.
	- removed forward-to and forward-to-port features, subsumed by
	  new forward zones.
	- fix parser to handle absent server: clause.
	- change untrusted rrset test to account for scrubber that is now
	  applied during the test (which removes the poison, by the way).
	- feature, addresses can be specified with @portnumber, like nsd.conf.
	- test config files changed over to new forwarder syntax.

27 June 2007: Wouter
	- delete of mesh does a postorder traverse of the tree.
	- found and fixed a memory leak. For TTL=0 messages, that would
	  not be cached, instead the msg-replyinfo structure was leaked.
	- changed server selection so it will filter out hosts that are
	  unresponsive. This is defined as a host with the maximum rto value.
	  This means that unbound tried the host for retries up to 120 secs.
	  The rto value will time out after host-ttl seconds from the cache.
	  This keeps such unresolvable queries from taking up resources.
	- utility for keeping histogram.

26 June 2007: Wouter
	- mesh is called by worker, and iterator uses it.
	  This removes the hierarchical code.
	  QueryTargets state and Finished state are merged for iterator.
	- forwarder mode no longer sets AA bit on first reply.
	- rcode in walk_supers is not needed.

25 June 2007: Wouter
	- more mesh work.
	- error encode routine for ease.

22 June 2007: Wouter
	- removed unused _node iterator value from rbtree_t. Takes up space.
	- iterator can handle querytargets state without a delegation point
	  set, so that a priming(stub) subquery error can be handled.
	- iterator stores if it is priming or not.
	- log_query_info() neater logging.
	- changed iterator so that it does not alter module_qstate.qinfo
	  but keeps a chase query info. Also query_flags are not altered,
	  the iterator uses chase_flags.
	- fixup crash in case no ports for the family exist.

21 June 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup secondary buffer in case of error callback.
	- cleanup slumber list of runnable states.
	- module_subreq_depth fails to work in slumber list.
	- fixup query release for cached results to sub targets.
	- neater error for tcp connection failure, shows addr in verbose.
	- rbtree_init so that it can be used with preallocated memory.

20 June 2007: Wouter
	- new -C option to enable coredumps after forking away.
	- doc update.
	- fixup CNAME generation by scrubber, and memory allocation of it.
	- fixup deletion of serviced queries when all callbacks delete too.
	- set num target queries to 0 when you move them to slumber list.
	- typo in check caused subquery errors to be ignored, fixed.
	- make lint happy about rlim_t.
	- freeup of modules after freeup of module-states.
	- duplicate replies work, this uses secondary udp buffer in outnet.

19 June 2007: Wouter
	- nicer layout in stats.c, review 0.3 change.
	- spelling improvement, review 0.3 change.
	- uncapped timeout for server selection, so that very fast or slow
	  servers will stand out from the rest.
	- target-fetch-policy: "3 2 1 0 0" config setting.
	- fixup queries answered without RD bit (for root prime results).
	- refuse AXFR and IXFR requests.
	- fixup RD flag in error reply from iterator. fixup RA flag from
	  worker error reply.
	- fixup encoding of very short edns buffer sizes, now sets TC bit.
	- config options harden-short-bufsize and harden-large-queries.

18 June 2007: Wouter
	- same, move subqueries to slumber list when first has resolved.
	- fixup last fix for duplicate callbacks.
	- another offbyone in targetcounter. Also in Java prototype by the way.

15 June 2007: Wouter
	- if a query asks to be notified of the same serviced query result
	  multiple times, this will succeed. Only one callback will happen;
	  multiple outbound-list entries result (but the double cleanup of it
	  will not matter).
	- when iterator moves on due to CNAME or referral, it will remove
	  the subqueries (for other targets). These are put on the slumber
	  list.
	- state module wait subq is OK with no new subqs, an old one may have
	  stopped, with an error, and it is still waiting for other ones.
	- if a query loops, halt entire query (easy way to clean up properly).

14 June 2007: Wouter
	- num query targets was > 0 , not >= 0 compared, so that fetch
	  policy of 0 did nothing.

13 June 2007: Wouter
	- debug option: configure --enable-static-exe for compile where
	  ldns and libevent are linked statically. Default is off.
	- make install and make uninstall. Works with static-exe and without.
	  installation of unbound binary and manual pages.
	- alignement problem fix on solaris 64.
	- fixup address in case of TCP error.

12 June 2007: Wouter
	- num target queries was set to 0 at a bad time. Default it to 0 and
	  increase as target queries are done.
	- synthesize CNAME and DNAME responses from the cache.
	- Updated doxygen config for doxygen 1.5.
	- aclocal newer version.
	- doxygen 1.5 fixes for comments (for the strict check on docs).

11 June 2007: Wouter
	- replies on TCP queries have the address field set in replyinfo,
	  for serviced queries, because the initiator does not know that
	  a TCP fallback has occured.
	- omit DNSSEC types from nonDO replies, except if qtype is ANY or
	  if qtype directly queries for the type (and then only show that
	  'unknown type' in the answer section).
	- fixed message parsing where rrsigs on their own would be put
	  in the signature list over the rrsig type.

7 June 2007: Wouter
	- fixup error in double linked list insertion for subqueries and
	  for outbound list of serviced queries for iterator module.
	- nicer printout of outgoing port selection. 
	- fixup cname target readout.
	- nicer debug output.
	- fixup rrset counts when prepending CNAMEs to the answer.
	- fixup rrset TTL for prepended CNAMEs.
	- process better check for looping modules, and which submodule to
	  run next.
	- subreq insertion code fixup for slumber list.
	- VERB_DETAIL, verbosity: 2 level gives short but readable output.
	  VERB_ALGO, verbosity: 3 gives extensive output.
	- fixup RA bit in cached replies.
	- fixup CNAME responses from the cache no longer partial response.
	- error in network send handled without leakage.
	- enable ip6 from config, and try ip6 addresses if available,
	  if ip6 is not connected, skips to next server.

	- iterator state finished.
	- subrequests without parent store in cache and stop.
	- worker slumber list for ongoing promiscuous queries.
	- subrequest error handling.
	- priming failure returns SERVFAIL.
	- priming gives LAME result, returns SERVFAIL.
	- debug routine to print dns_msg as handled by iterator.
	- memleak in config file stubs fixup.
	- more small bugs, in scrubber, query compare no ID for lookup,
	  in dname validation for NS targets.
	- sets entry.key for new special allocs.
	- lognametypeclass can display unknown types and classes.

4 June 2007: Wouter
	- random selection of equally preferred nameserver targets.
	- reply info copy routine. Reuses existing code.
	- cache lameness in response handling.
	- do not touch qstate after worker_process_query because it may have
	  been deleted by that routine.
	- Prime response state.
	- Process target response state.
	- some memcmp changed to dname_compare for case preservation.

1 June 2007: Wouter

	  and lameness is checked too.
	- delegation point copy routine.

30 May 2007: Wouter
	- removed FLAG_CD from message and rrset caches. This was useful for
	  an agnostic forwarder, but not for a sophisticated (trust value per
	  rrset enabled) cache.
	- iterator reponse typing.
	- iterator cname handle.
	- iterator prime start.
	- subquery work.
	- processInitRequest and processInitRequest2.
	- cache synthesizes referral messages, with DS and NSEC.
	- processInitRequest3.
	- if a request creates multiple subrequests these are all activated.

29 May 2007: Wouter
	- routines to lock and unlock array of rrsets moved to cache/rrset.

25 May 2007: Wouter
	- Acknowledge use of unbound-java code in iterator. Nicer readme.
	- services/cache/dns.c DNS Cache. Hybrid cache uses msgcache and
	  rrset cache from module environment.
	- packed rrset key has type and class as easily accessable struct
	  members. They are still kept in network format for fast msg encode.
	- dns cache find_delegation routine.

	- dns cache lookup setup.

24 May 2007: Wouter
	- small changes to prepare for subqueries.

	- outside network serviced queries, contain edns and tcp fallback,
	  and udp retries and rtt timing.

	- message encoding creates truncated TC flagged messages if they do 
	  not fit, and will leave out (whole)rrsets from additional if needed.

1 May 2007: Wouter
	- decompress query section, extremely lenient acceptance.
	  But only for answers from other servers, not for plain queries.
	- compression and decompression test cases.
	- some stats added.
	- example.conf interface: line is changed from 127.0.0.1 which leads
	  to problems if used (restricting communication to the localhost),
	  to a documentation and test address.

	- test from file and fixes
		* double frees fixed in error conditions.
		* types with less than full rdata allowed by parser.
		  Some dynamic update packets seem to use it.

	  in netevent (which is there to please lint) can be correct.
	  The type on several OSes ranges from int, int32, uint32, size_t.
	  Detects unsigned or signed using math trick.
	- constants for DNS flags. 
	- compilation without locks fixup.
	- removed include of unportable header from lookup3.c.
	- more portable use of struct msghdr.
	- casts for printf warning portability.
	- tweaks to tests to port them to the testbed.

	- configure.ac moved to 0.2.
	- query_info and replymsg util/data structure.

9 March 2007: Wouter
	- added rwlock writelock checking.
	  So it will keep track of the writelock, and readlocks are enforced
	  to not change protected memory areas.
	- log_hex function to dump hex strings to the logfile.
	- checklocks zeroes its destroyed lock after checking memory areas.
	- unit test for alloc.
	- identifier for union in checklocks to please older compilers.
	- created 0.1 tag.

8 March 2007: Wouter
	- Reviewed checklock code.

7 March 2007: Wouter
	- created a wrapper around thread calls that performs some basic
	  checking for data race and deadlock, and basic performance 
	  contention measurement.

6 March 2007: Wouter
	- Testbed works with threading (different machines, different options).
	- alloc work, does the special type.

2 March 2007: Wouter
	- do not compile fork funcs unless needed. Otherwise will give
	  type errors as their typedefs have not been enabled.
	- log shows thread numbers much more nicely (and portably).
	- even on systems with nonthreadsafe libevent signal handling,
	  unbound will exit if given a signal.
	  Reloads will not work, and exit is not graceful.
	- start of alloc framework layout.

1 March 2007: Wouter
	- Signals, libevent and threads work well, with libevent patch and
	  changes to code (close after event_del).
	- set ipc pipes nonblocking.

27 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_thread_join portable definition.
	- forking is used if no threading is available.
	  Tested, it works, since pipes work across processes as well.
	  Thread_join is replaced with waitpid. 
	- During reloads the daemon will temporarily handle signals,
	  so that they do not result in problems.
	- Also randomize the outgoing port range for tests.
	- If query list is full, will stop selecting listening ports for read.
	  This makes all threads service incoming requests, instead of one.
	  No memory is leaking during reloads, service of queries, etc.
	- test that uses ldns-testns -f to test threading. Have to answer
	  three queries at the same time.
	- with verbose=0 operates quietly.

26 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_random code used to select ID and port.
	- log code prints thread id.
	- unbound can thread itself, with reload(HUP) and quit working
	  correctly.
	- don't open pipes for #0, doesn't need it.
	- listens to SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT (all quit) and SIGHUP (reload).

23 February 2007: Wouter
	- Can do reloads on sigHUP. Everything is stopped, and freed,
	  except the listening ports. Then the config file is reread.
	  And everything is started again (and listening ports if needed).
	- Ports for queries are shared.
	- config file added interface:, chroot: and username:.
	- config file: directory, logfile, pidfile. And they work too.
	- will daemonize by default now. Use -d to stay in the foreground.
	- got BSD random[256 state] code, made it threadsafe. util/random.

22 February 2007: Wouter
	- Have a config file. Removed commandline options, moved to config.
	- tests use config file.

21 February 2007: Wouter
	- put -c option in man page.
	- minievent fd array capped by FD_SETSIZE.

20 February 2007: Wouter

	- can use no locks, or solaris native thread library.
	- added yacc and lex configure, and config file parsing code.
	  also makedist.sh, and manpage.
	- put include errno.h in config.h

19 February 2007: Wouter
	- Created 0.0 svn tag.
	- added acx_pthread.m4 autoconf check for pthreads from 
	  the autoconf archive. It is GPL-with-autoconf-exception Licensed.
	  You can specify --with-pthreads, or --without-pthreads to configure.

	- Updated testbed script, works better by using make on remote end.
	- removed check decls, we can compile without them.
	- makefile supports LIBOBJ replacements.
	- docs checks ignore compat code.
	- added util/mini-event.c and .h, a select based alternative used with
	  ./configure --with-libevent=no
	  It is limited to 1024 file descriptors, and has less features.
	- will not create ip6 sockets if ip6 not on the machine.

15 February 2007: Wouter
	- port to FreeBSD 4.11 Dec Alpha. Also works on Solaris 10 sparc64,
	  Solaris 9, FreeBSD 6, Linux i386 and OSX powerpc.
	- malloc rndstate, so that it is aligned for access.
	- fixed rbtree cleanup with postorder traverse.
	- fixed pending messages are deleted when handled.
	- You can control verbosity; default is not verbose, every -v
	  adds more verbosity.

14 February 2007: Wouter
	- Included configure.ac changes from ldns.
	- detect (some) headers before the standards check.
	- do not use isblank to test c99, since its not available on solaris9.
	- review of testcode.
		* entries in a RANGE are no longer reversed.
		* print name of file with replay entry parse errors.
	- port to OSX: cast to int for some prints of sizet.
	- Makefile copies ldnstestpkts.c before doing dependencies on it.

13 February 2007: Wouter
	- work on fake events, first fwd replay works.
	- events can do timeouts and errors on queries to servers.
	- test package that runs replay scenarios.

12 February 2007: Wouter
	- work on fake events.

9 February 2007: Wouter
	- replay file reading.
	- fake event setup, it creates fake structures, and teardowns,
	  added signal callbacks to reply to be able to fake those,
	  and main structure of event replay routines.

8 February 2007: Wouter
	- added tcp test.
	- replay storage.
	- testcode/fake_event work.

7 February 2007: Wouter
	- return answer with the same ID as query was sent with.
	- created udp forwarder test. I've done some effort to make it perform
	  quickly. After servers are created, no big sleep statements but
	  it checks the logfiles to see if servers have come up. Takes 0.14s.
	- set addrlen value when calling recvfrom.
	- comparison of addrs more portable.
	- LIBEVENT option for testbed to set libevent directory.
	- work on tcp input.

6 February 2007: Wouter
	- reviewed code and improved in places.

	- unit test for strisip6.

2 February 2007: Wouter
	- Created udp4 and udp6 port arrays to provide service for both
	  address families.
	- uses IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU for udp6 ,IPV6_V6ONLY to make ip6 sockets.
	- listens on both ip4 and ip6 ports to provide correct return address.
	- worker fwder address filled correctly.
	- fixup timer code.
	- forwards udp queries and sends answer.

1 February 2007: Wouter
	- outside network more UDP work.
	- moved * closer to type.
	- comm_timer object and events.

31 January 2007: Wouter

	- copied over rbtree implementation from NSD (BSD licensed too).
	- outgoing network query service work.

30 January 2007: Wouter
	- links in example/ldns-testpkts.c and .h for premade packet support.
	- added callback argument to listen_dnsport and daemon/worker.

	- fixed lint so it may work on BSD.
	- put license into header of every file.
	- created verbosity flag.
	- fixed libevent configure flag.

	- getopt in daemon. fatal_exit() and verbose() logging funcs.
	- created log_assert, that throws assertions to the logfile.
	- listen_dnsport service. Binds ports.

24  January 2007: Wouter
	- cleaned up configure.ac.

23  January 2007: Wouter
	- added libevent to configure to link with.
	- util/netevent setup work.
	- configure searches for libevent.
	- search for libs at end of configure (when other headers and types
	  have been found).
	- doxygen works with ATTR_UNUSED().
	- util/netevent implementation.

22  January 2007: Wouter
	- Designed header file for network communication.

16  January 2007: Wouter
	- added readme.svn and readme.tests.

4 January 2007: Wouter
	- Testbed script (run on multiple platforms the test set).
