* Uses the following libraries; 
  * ldns	http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/ldns/			(BSD license)
  * libevent	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/		(BSD license)

* Create build environment 
  * run libtoolize -c if config.sub is missing, or run glibtoolize.
  * autoreconf (autoheader && autoconf), if ./configure is missing.

* Make and install: ./configure; make; make install
  * --with-ldns=/path/to/ldns
  	If ldns is not detected on the system, a prepackaged tarball
	of the ldns library is used to compile and statically link against.
	If detected on the system, it will dynamically link against it.
  * --with-libevent=/path/to/libevent
  	Can be set to either the system install or the build directory.
	--with-libevent=no gives a builtin alternative implementation.
	libevent is useful when having many (thousands) of outgoing ports.
	This improves randomization and spoof resistance. For the default 
	of 16 ports the builtin alternative works well.
  * --without-pthreads 
	This disables pthreads, and uses Solaris thr library or no threading. 
	Without this option the pthreads library is detected automatically.
  * --enable-static-exe
	This enables a debug option to statically link, against ldns and 
	libevent libraries.
  * --enable-lock-checks
  	This enables a debug option to check lock and unlock calls. It needs
	a recent pthreads library to work.
  * --enable-alloc-checks
	This enables a debug option to check malloc (calloc, realloc, free).
	The server periodically checks if the amount of memory used fits with
	the amount of memory it thinks it should be using, and reports 
	memory usage in detail.

* 'make test' attempts to run a series of tests, depending on the support
  programs that are installed.

Known issues
------------
o If libevent is older (before 1.3c), unbound will exit instead of reload
  on sighup. On a restart 'did not exit gracefully last time' warning is 
  printed. Perform ./configure --with-libevent=no or update libevent, rerun 
  configure and recompile unbound to make sighup work correctly.

Acknowledgements
----------------
o Thanks to David Blacka and Matt Larson (Verisign) for the unbound-java
  prototype. Design and code from that prototype has been used to create
  this program. Such as the iterator state machine and the cache design.
o Other code origins are from the NSD (NLnet Labs) and LDNS (NLnet Labs)
  projects. Such as buffer, region-allocator and red-black tree code.
o See Credits file for contributors.
