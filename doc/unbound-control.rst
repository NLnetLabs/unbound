unbound-control(8)
==================

Synopsis
--------

**unbound-control** [``-hq``] [``-c cfgfile``] [``-s server``] command

Description
-----------

``unbound-control`` performs remote administration on the
:doc:`unbound(8)</manpages/unbound>` DNS server.
It reads the configuration file, contacts the Unbound server over TLS sends the
command and displays the result.

The available options are:

.. option:: -h

    Show the version and commandline option help.

.. option:: -c <cfgfile>

    The config file to read with settings.
    If not given the default config file
    :file:`@ub_conf_file@` is used.

.. option:: -s <server[@port]>

    IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to contact.
    If not given, the address is read from the config file.

.. option:: -q

    Quiet, if the option is given it does not print anything if it works ok.

Commands
--------

There are several commands that the server understands.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@start@@
    Start the server.
    Simply execs :doc:`unbound(8)</manpages/unbound>`.
    The ``unbound`` executable is searched for in the **PATH** set in the
    environment.
    It is started with the config file specified using :option:`-c` or the
    default config file.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@stop@@
    Stop the server.
    The server daemon exits.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@reload@@
    Reload the server.
    This flushes the cache and reads the config file fresh.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@reload_keep_cache@@
    Reload the server but try to keep the RRset and message cache if
    (re)configuration allows for it.
    That means the caches sizes and the number of threads must not change
    between reloads.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@fast_reload@@ [``+dpv``]
    Reload the server, but keep downtime to a minimum, so that user queries
    keep seeing service.
    This needs the code compiled with threads.
    The config is loaded in a thread, and prepared, then it briefly pauses the
    existing server and updates config options.
    The intent is that the pause does not impact the service of user queries.
    The cache is kept.
    Also user queries worked on are kept and continue, but with the new config
    options.

    .. note::
        This command is experimental at this time.

    The amount of temporal memory needed during a fast_reload is twice the
    amount needed for configuration.
    This is because Unbound temporarily needs to store both current
    configuration values and new ones while trying to fast_reload.
    Zones loaded from disk (authority zones and RPZ zones) are included in such
    memory needs.

    Options that can be changed are for
    :ref:`forwards<unbound.conf.forward>`,
    :ref:`stubs<unbound.conf.stub>`,
    :ref:`views<unbound.conf.view>`,

    Also
    :ref:`access-control<unbound.conf.access-control>` and similar options,
    :ref:`interface-action<unbound.conf.interface-action>` and similar
    options and
    :ref:`tcp-connection-limit<unbound.conf.tcp-connection-limit>`.

    :ref:`dnstap-tls-client-cert-file<unbound.conf.dnstap.dnstap-tls-client-cert-file>`.

    The options
    :ref:`dnstap-send-identity<unbound.conf.dnstap.dnstap-send-identity>`,
    :ref:`dnstap-send-version<unbound.conf.dnstap.dnstap-send-version>`,
    :ref:`dnstap-identity<unbound.conf.dnstap.dnstap-identity>`, and
    :ref:`dnstap-version<unbound.conf.dnstap.dnstap-version>` can be loaded
    when ``+p`` is not used.

    The ``+v`` option makes the output verbose which includes the time it took
    to do the reload.
    With ``+vv`` it is more verbose which includes the amount of memory that
    was allocated temporarily to perform the reload; this amount of memory can
    be big if the config has large contents.
    In the timing output the 'reload' time is the time during which the server
    was paused.

    The ``+p`` option makes the reload not pause threads, they keep running.
    Locks are acquired, but items are updated in sequence, so it is possible
    for threads to see an inconsistent state with some options from the old
    and some options from the new config, such as cache TTL parameters from the
    old config and forwards from the new config.
    The stubs and forwards are updated at the same time, so that they are
    viewed consistently, either old or new values together.
    The option makes the reload time take eg. 3 microseconds instead of 0.3
    milliseconds during which the worker threads are interrupted.
    So, the interruption is much shorter, at the expense of some inconsistency.
    After the reload itself, every worker thread is briefly contacted to make
    them release resources, this makes the delete timing a little longer, and
    takes up time from the remote control servicing worker thread.

    With the nopause option (``+p``), the reload does not work to reload some
    options, that fast reload works on without the nopause option:

    :ref:`ratelimit-for-domain<unbound.conf.ratelimit-for-domain>`.

    The ``+d`` option makes the reload drop queries that the worker threads are
    working on.
    This is like
    :ref:`flush_requestlist<unbound-control.commands.flush_requestlist>`.
    Without it the queries are kept so that users keep getting answers for
    those queries that are currently processed.
    The drop makes it so that queries during the life time of the
    query processing see only old, or only new config options.

    When there are changes to the config tags, from the
    :ref:`define-tag<unbound.conf.define-tag>` option,
    then the ``+d`` option is implicitly turned on with a warning printout, and
    queries are dropped.
    This is to stop references to the old tag information, by the old
    queries.
    If the number of tags is increased in the newly loaded config, by
    adding tags at the end, then the implicit ``+d`` option is not needed.

    For response ip, that is actions associated with IP addresses, and perhaps
    intersected with access control tag and action information, those settings
    are stored with a query when it comes in based on its source IP address.
    The old information is kept with the query until the queries are done.
    This is gone when those queries are resolved and finished, or it is
    possible to flush the requestlist with ``+d``.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@verbosity@@ *number*
    Change verbosity value for logging.
    Same values as the **verbosity:** keyword in
    :doc:`unbound.conf(5)</manpages/unbound.conf>`.
    This new setting lasts until the server is issued a reload (taken from
    config file again), or the next verbosity control command.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@log_reopen@@
    Reopen the logfile, close and open it.
    Useful for logrotation to make the daemon release the file it is logging
    to.
    If you are using syslog it will attempt to close and open the syslog (which
    may not work if chrooted).


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@stats@@
    Print statistics.
    Resets the internal counters to zero, this can be controlled using the
    **statistics-cumulative:** config statement.
    Statistics are printed with one ``[name]: [value]`` per line.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@stats_noreset@@
    Peek at statistics.
    Prints them like the stats command does, but does not reset the internal
    counters to zero.

    Display server status.
    Exit code 3 if not running (the connection to the port is refused), 1 on
    error, 0 if running.

    Add new local zone with name and type.
    Like local-zone config statement.
    If the zone already exists, the type is changed to the given argument.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@local_zone_remove@@ *name*
    Remove the local zone with the given name.
    Removes all local data inside it.
    If the zone does not exist, the command succeeds.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@local_data@@ *RR data...*
    Add new local data, the given resource record.
    Like **local-data:** keyword, except for when no covering zone exists.
    In that case this remote control command creates a transparent zone with
    the same name as this record.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@local_data_remove@@ *name*
    Remove all RR data from local name.
    If the name already has no items, nothing happens.
    Often results in NXDOMAIN for the name (in a static zone), but if the name
    has become an empty nonterminal (there is still data in domain names below
    the removed name), NOERROR nodata answers are the result for that name.

    You can redirect it to a file to store the cache in a file.
    Not supported in remote Unbounds in multi-process operation.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@load_cache@@
    The contents of the cache is loaded from stdin.
    Uses the same format as dump_cache uses.
    Loading the cache with old, or wrong data can result in old or wrong data
    returned to clients.
    Loading data into the cache in this way is supported in order to aid with
    debugging.
    Not supported in remote Unbounds in multi-process operation.

    Remove the name from the cache.
    Removes the types A, AAAA, NS, SOA, CNAME, DNAME, MX, PTR, SRV, NAPTR,
    SVCB and HTTPS.
    Because that is fast to do.
    Other record types can be removed using **flush_type** or **flush_zone**.

    The ``+c`` option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
    If cachedb is in use.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@flush_type@@ [``+c``] *name type*
    Remove the name, type information from the cache.

    The ``+c`` option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.

@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@flush_zone@@ [``+c``] name
    Remove all information at or below the name from the cache.
    The rrsets and key entries are removed so that new lookups will be
    performed.
    This needs to walk and inspect the entire cache, and is a slow operation.
    The entries are set to expired in the implementation of this command (so,
    with serve-expired enabled, it'll serve that information but schedule a
    prefetch for new information).

    The ``+c`` option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.
    If cachedb is in use.

    If cachedb is in use.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@flush_negative@@ [``+c``]
    Remove all negative data from the cache.
    This is nxdomain answers, nodata answers and servfail answers.
    Also removes bad key entries (which could be due to failed lookups) from
    the dnssec key cache, and iterator last-resort lookup failures from the
    rrset cache.

    The ``+c`` option removes the items also from the cachedb cache.

    Drop the queries that are worked on.
    Stops working on the queries that the server is working on now.
    The cache is unaffected.
    No reply is sent for those queries, probably making those users request
    again later.
    Useful to make the server restart working on queries with new settings,
    such as a higher verbosity level.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@dump_requestlist@@
    Show what is worked on.
    Prints all queries that the server is currently working on.
    Prints the time that users have been waiting.
    For internal requests, no time is printed.
    And then prints out the module status.
    This prints the queries from the first thread, and not queries that are
    being serviced from other threads.


@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@flush_infra@@ *all|IP*
    If all then entire infra cache is emptied.
    If a specific IP address, the entry for that address is removed from the

@@UAHL@unbound-control.commands@set_option@@ *opt: val*
    Set the option to the given value without a reload.
    The cache is therefore not flushed.
    The option must end with a ``':'`` and whitespace must be between the
    option and the value.
    Some values may not have an effect if set this way, the new values are not
    written to the config file, not all options are supported.
    This is different from the set_option call in libunbound, where all values
    work because Unbound has not been initialized.

    For some options a list of values, one on each line, is printed.
    The options are shown from the config file as modified with set_option.
    For some options an override may have been taken that does not show up with
    this command, not results from e.g. the verbosity and forward control

    Setup forwarding mode.
    Configures if the server should ask other upstream nameservers, should go
    to the internet root nameservers itself, or show the current config.
    You could pass the nameservers after a DHCP update.

    Without arguments the current list of addresses used to forward all queries
    to is printed.
    On startup this is from the forward-zone ``"."`` configuration.
    Afterwards it shows the status.
    It prints off when no forwarding is used.

    If off is passed, forwarding is disabled and the root nameservers are

    Add or replace a cookie secret persistently.

    Cookie secrets can be either **active** or **staging**.
    **Active** cookie secrets are used to create DNS Cookies, but verification
    of a DNS Cookie succeeds with any of the **active** or **staging** cookie
    secrets.
    The state of the current cookie secrets can be printed with the
    :ref:`print_cookie_secrets<unbound-control.commands.print_cookie_secrets>`
    command.

    When there are no cookie secrets configured yet, the *secret* is added as
    **active**.
    If there is already an **active** cookie secret, the *secret* is added as
    **staging** or replacing an existing **staging** secret.

    To "roll" a cookie secret used in an anycast set.
    The new secret has to be added as **staging** secret to **all** nodes in
    the anycast set.
    When **all** nodes can verify DNS Cookies with the new secret, the new
    secret can be activated with the
    :ref:`activate_cookie_secret<unbound-control.commands.activate_cookie_secret>`

    the previous secret can be dropped with the

    Persistence is accomplished by writing to a file which is configured with

Exit Code
---------

The ``unbound-control`` program exits with status code 1 on error, 0 on
success.

Set Up
------

The setup requires a self-signed certificate and private keys for both the
server and client.
The script ``unbound-control-setup`` generates these in the default run
directory, or with ``-d`` in another directory.
If you change the access control permissions on the key files you can decide
who can use ``unbound-control``, by default owner and group but not all users.
Run the script under the same username as you have configured in
:file:`unbound.conf` or as root, so that the daemon is permitted to read the
files, for example with:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u unbound unbound-control-setup

If you have not configured a username in :file:`unbound.conf`, the keys need
read permission for the user credentials under which the daemon is started.
The script preserves private keys present in the directory.
After running the script as root, turn on
:ref:`control-enable<unbound.conf.remote.control-enable>` in
:file:`unbound.conf`.
