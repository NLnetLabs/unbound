; For further details about the directives used in this unit file, including
; the below, please refer to systemd's official documentation, available at
; https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html.
;
;
;   - `ProtectSystem=strict` implies we mount the entire file system hierarchy
;     read-only for the processes invoked by the unit except for the API file
;     system subtrees /dev, /proc and /sys (which are protected by
;     PrivateDevices=, ProtectKernelTunables=, ProtectControlGroups=).
;
;   - `PrivateTmp=yes` secures access to temporary files of the process, and
;     makes sharing between processes via /tmp or /var/tmp impossible.
;
;   - `ProtectHome=yes` makes the directories /home, /root, and /run/user
;     inaccessible and empty for processes invoked by the unit.
;
;   - `ProtectControlGroups=yes` makes the Linux Control Groups hierarchies
;     (accessible through /sys/fs/cgroup) read-only to all processes invoked by
;     the unit. It also implies `MountAPIVFS=yes`.
;
;   - `RuntimeDirectory=unbound` creates a /run/unbound directory, owned by the
;     unit User and Group with read-write permissions (0755) as soon as the
;     unit starts. This allows unbound to store its pidfile. The directory and
;     its content are automatically removed by systemd when the unit stops.
;
;   - `NoNewPrivileges=yes` ensures that the service process and all its
;     children can never gain new privileges through execve().
;
;   - `RestrictSUIDSGID=yes` ensures that any attempts to set the set-user-ID
;     (SUID) or set-group-ID (SGID) bits on files or directories will be denied.
;
;   - `RestrictRealTime=yes` ensures that any attempts to enable realtime
;     scheduling in a process invoked by the unit will be denied.
;
;   - `RestrictNamespaces=yes` ensures that access to any kind of namespacing
;     is prohibited.
;
;   - `LockPersonality=yes` locks down the personality system call so that the
;     kernel execution domain may not be changed from the default.
;
;   - With /etc/systemd/network/*.network a setting to make sure the network
;     is not considered online too early, can reduce network unreachable
;     errors on server start:
;     [Link]
;     RequiredForOnline=routable
