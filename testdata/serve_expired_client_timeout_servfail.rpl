SCENARIO_BEGIN Test serve-expired with client-timeout and a SERVFAIL upstream reply
; Scenario overview:
; - query for example.com. IN A
; - check that we get an answer for example.com. IN A with the correct TTL
; - query again right after the TTL expired
; - answer from upstream is servfail
; - (expired cached answer will not be replaced, instead marked as unresolvable for NORR_TTL(5))
; - check that we get the expired cached answer
; - query again (the answer is available on the upstream server now)
; - check that we get the immediate expired answer back instead
; - (the upstream query does happen after the expired reply and updates the cache)
; - query again (the upstream has no answer)
; - check that we get the freshly cached answer
